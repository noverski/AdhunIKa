Concept
 

The whole concept of the installation is to see how the physical data of the depth of space between objects can be visually communicated within the given architecture.

By using the robotic arm as a responsive media element, the presence of people will allow the robot to change what has already been there by negotiating the space in need to reconstruct the structure to add-on to the need of human. In this way, one would be able to understand that with the aid of technology fused into the structure of a building, the architecture is able to respond by reconfiguring the given architectural space.
