------------------------------ INTRODUCTION -----------------------------------

The idea is to have an installation where the device reconfigures itself according to its inhabitant’s activities. Transforming the system based on intensity of particular regions of the given environment, which would therefore change the architecture design. There always had been a need to analyze the relation of the codes that the computer generates when it retrieves any form of data input. One of the direct way to demonstrate this is by allowing the system to positioning the cubes relative to one another in real-time autonomously.

“Architecture is an evolving, technologically enhanced means of organizing sophisticated spatial data and programming information into structural medium that synthesize complex geometries and aspects of human action.“
Iiona Lenard, Visual Artist

In general, architecture refers to many types of things, from Computing (Architecture in Network) to products and formation of a construction. In this work, the type of architecture used will be the art of the building: the art of designing.

In today’s world, any physical structure has controlled mechanism and information based on the human intervention. 	As machines are starting to become capable of multiplying themselves through the software programs which are meant as guides initially to follow certain rules in the presence of humans. Thus, leads to an increase fear of machines taking over activities and control of what a human needs. Under scientific research, there is a high probability of the predictability in which the machines gain access to govern over the human.

At a higher level, the unpredictability of the human computer relationship can be notched up by the usage of Autonomous Simulation. The simulation is basically a responsive artificial environment, where it is capable of evolving and reacting based on the influence of the human activity and interaction. This is possible because 

“The cultural and social revolution brought by an ear of accelerated changes, in which data seeds invisibly around the globe and the flow of information has superseded material exchange and complex digital infrastructures have inscribed themselves within out recognizable mechanical and urban pattern. “  1

Therefore, enhancing the simulation through the reconfiguration of the artificial intelligent system. In other words, it is to see how the physical data of its given subject can be visually communicated within the given architecture.

Robotics is a sort of device  that is controlled by an application interface to the physical world. By using the device as a responsive media element, the presence of people will allow the robot to change what has already been there by negotiating the space in need to reconfigure the structure based in the algorithm of alphabets. In this way, one would be able to understand that with the aid of technology fused into the structure of a building, the architecture will be transformed from basic functionality to a virtual playgrounds visitor to recombine and transfigure the system.

In this device, there are 9 cubes with each cube representing a category of the needed elements of architecture. These are Additive vs. Subtractive, Contrast, Perception, Regional Traditional, Transitional Styles, Modernism General, Postmodernism and Hybrid.

In Additive vs. Subtractive, the supposed elements are space and form. In additive arrangement the pieces appear to have been combined together to create the whole structure. In subtractive arrangement it would appear as been chipped away from a block, much like a sculptor chips away pieces until the final sculpture is perceptible. 

In Contrast, to bring up the details outs, the materials, sizes of neighboring spaces, extent of details are considered to get attention.

A Perception is needed when designing and constructing a structure based on senses, reasons and emotion.

	
In Regional Tradition, these styles each originate from a specific region of the world, having grown out of local cultures and conditions. Many of them continue to be used today, sometimes in modified forms. A few supporting styles would be Buddhist, Japanese customary, Islamic Style and European customary.
	
In Transitional Styles, are styles from the century leading up to the modern era. It includes Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Arts and Crafts and Prairie Style.

In Modernism General, styles that started in and grew out of the modern movement in the first half of the 20th century. While the modern movement started in Europe, it quickly spread to North America and much of the rest of the world. Within modernism there are sub-categories such as Deconstructivism, International Style, Structural Expressionism.

Unlike Modernism, Postmodernism uses the International Style, which avoids decoration, at the same time it also represents a return to decoration for beautification. And often intentionally tries to contrast with other styles.

Finally in Hybrid, the buildings are constructed by combining two or more architectural styles in a way that compliment one another and create an exciting new result. Often such buildings are the product of an older building designed in a traditional style being renovated or transformed with elements from modern styles.

By fusing architecture, technology and interaction, we are able to explore the potential between two main mediums, Architecture and Technology.


----------------------------------- Proposed Medium/Materials -----------------------------------

For the installation, the mediums required would be a computing device with programming software called processing, a webcam, an Arduino O/I Board, a home-made robotic arm and clay.

Using the processing software, we are able to have a webcam visual input and to generate it to data, analyze it and create an output to the Arduino board, based on a algorithm created for the processing. 

In the Arduino board, it analyzes the received data from the processing, transcode it from a digital to analog by controlling the movements of the motors situated in the robotic arm.


----------------------------------- METHODOLOGY -----------------------------------

Initially, by immersing the given environment, the webcam sends live updates to the processing software, which analyzes it and generates data based on it refined algorithm, Which is then sent over to the Arduino software., which in return, analyze the given data, and interprets its understanding to given output. Which materialize the information to the robotic arm, which would eventually construct the design in the styling clay.
